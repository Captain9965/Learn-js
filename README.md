# Javascript Overview
Initially developed under the name `Mocha` and `Mona` and later `livescript` by Netscape employee Brandan Eich.
Used by browsers to add dynamism to web pages and hence to do this, they have interpreters that run js like `Chakra` for Edge, `v8` for Chrome and `SpiderMonkey` in Firefox. Nowadays has the capability to run server side functions with `Nodejs`. 
js cannot read/write files on the hard disk, copy them or execute programs because it doesn't have direct access to os system functions. It also cannot protect the page source or image and cannot access web pages hosted by another domain.
